# Add Jira issue type as tag (epic, story, etc.)
# Make sure these tags exist in Things first!
JIRA_TYPE_TAG=true

# Set task deadlines based on the end date of active/future Jira sprints

# Status Mapping - Configure how JIRA statuses map to Things scheduling

# Tickets with these statuses go to "Today" in Things
TODAY_STATUS=["In Progress", "Active", "Doing"]

# Tickets with these statuses are marked as completed in Things
COMPLETED_STATUS=["Done", "Closed", "Resolved", "Completed"]

# Set the scheduling mode for Things tasks
#
# When set to "status", the lists below determine how tasks are scheduled
# between "Anytime" and "Someday". When set to "sprint", tasks in the active
# sprint are set to "Anytime" and all other tasks are set to "Someday".
SCHEDULING_MODE=status

# In "status" mode, tickets with these statuses go to "Anytime" in Things
# (default for unlisted statuses)

# In "status" mode, tickets with these statuses go to "Someday" in Things
SOMEDAY_STATUS=["Backlog", "Future", "Product Backlog", "Icebox"]

# Optional: Configure additional queries to map to different Things projects
#
# Additional projects are defined by adding THINGS_PROJECT__<name> and JIRA_JQL_QUERY__<name>
#
# For example, to create separate projects for web and API tickets, you can add:
#
# THINGS_PROJECT__API=API Tickets
# JIRA_JQL_QUERY__API=assignee = currentUser() AND updated >= -14d AND project = API
#
# THINGS_PROJECT__WEB=Web Tickets
# JIRA_JQL_QUERY__WEB=assignee = currentUser() AND updated >= -14d AND project = WEB
#
# Since there's a 1:1 mapping between Jira tickets and Things tasks, tickets
# can only be assigned to one project at a time. Because of this, these queries
# should be non-overlapping, both between each other and with the main JIRA_JQL_QUERY.
#
# This can also be used to separate tickets in the active sprint from those in the backlog:
#
# Configure the "main" project/query as the backlog:
#
# THINGS_PROJECT=Backlog
# JIRA_JQL_QUERY=assignee = currentUser() AND updated >= -14d AND (Sprint IS null OR Sprint NOT IN openSprints())
#
# Add a second project for the active sprint:
#
# THINGS_PROJECT__ACTIVE=Current Sprint
# JIRA_JQL_QUERY__ACTIVE=assignee = currentUser() AND Sprint IN openSprints()

# Should missing tickets be marked as canceled in Things?
# For example, if a ticket is reassigned or deleted in Jira, it will not be returned in the JQL fetch.
CANCEL_MISSING_TICKETS=false
